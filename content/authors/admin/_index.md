Petro Junior is a computational scientist and aerospace engineer with primary focus on the design, analysis, and implementation of large-scale algorithms on massively-parallel supercomputers for the simulation and modelling of complex flow physics and combustion in advanced propulsion systems. 

He is currently a PhD/MSc student under the supervision of Prof. Vigor Yang at Georgia Tech. His thesis focuses on combining state-of-the-art tools in computer simulations, heterogeneous parallel computing, and artificial intelligence for data-enabled design of rocket injectors at extreme physical conditions. His research collaborators include Prof. Xingjian Wang at Florida Tech and Prof. Jean-Pierre Hickey at University of Waterloo.

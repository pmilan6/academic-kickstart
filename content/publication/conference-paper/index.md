# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.

summary: A large-eddy simulation (LES) based study is conducted to assess the effect of turbulent combustion closures on the prediction of flow and flame dynamics in a single-element lean- direct injection (LDI) combustor. We consider three different finite-rate kinetics models, namely, the quasi-laminar model (QL), the partially stirred reactor model (PaSR) and the linear eddy mixing model in LES (LEMLES). A comprehensive comparison of various quantities shows that, while general features of swirl spray combustion are similar in all the three cases, differences are also apparent, and the PaSR predictions seem in better agreement with predictions by the LEMLES case compared to the QL case.
